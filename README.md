## FeatureBee Client

The client is the application where you implement the features. The features are toggled in an IF-Statement:

    if (Feature.IsEnabled("My Feature"))
    {
      ViewBag.Message = "Congratulations!";
    }

You can unit test this by injecting your own evaluator: 

    Feature.InjectEvaluator(featureName => true);
    if (Feature.IsEnabled("My Feature")) // always true
    {
      ViewBag.Message = "Congratulations!";
    }

## FeatureBee TrayIcon

The TrayIcon is displayed on the page, and can be used to turn features off and on for the current user.
